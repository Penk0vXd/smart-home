# ESP32 Smart Home System

## ‚úÖ Overview

This project implements a complete smart home system using an ESP32 DevKit V1 board, allowing control of multiple devices through MQTT protocol using HiveMQ Cloud as the broker. The system provides:

- Secure connection to MQTT broker using TLS
- Control of 3 LED lights via MQTT topics
- Temperature and humidity monitoring with DHT22 sensor
- Alarm system with a multi-tone buzzer that can be triggered via MQTT or physical button
- Web interface for local control with real-time sensor readings
- Automatic reconnection to WiFi and MQTT broker

## üìã Arduino Code Explanation

The code is structured into the following sections:

1. **Initialization and Configuration**
   - Pin definitions and MQTT topics
   - WiFi and MQTT broker settings
   - Sensor and device state variables

2. **Web Server Implementation**
   - Embedded HTML/CSS/JS for responsive web interface
   - API endpoints for device control and sensor data

3. **MQTT Functionality**
   - Secure TLS connection with `setInsecure()`
   - Unique client ID based on ESP32 MAC address
   - Topic subscription and message handling
   - Status publishing for all devices

4. **Sensor and Device Control**
   - DHT22 temperature/humidity reading
   - LED control via GPIO outputs
   - Buzzer alarm pattern generation
   - Button debounce handling

5. **Robust Connection Management**
   - WiFi reconnection logic

## üîß Troubleshooting Tips

### Connection Issues
1. **WiFi Connection Failures**
   - Verify SSID and password are correct
   - Ensure ESP32 is within range of WiFi router
   - Check if router has too many connected devices

2. **MQTT Connection Failures**
   - Verify HiveMQ Cloud credentials (username/password)
   - Check error code from `mqttClient.state()` for specific issues:
     - `-4`: Connection timeout - Check network speed
     - `-3`: Connection lost - Check network stability
     - `-2`: Connect failed - Verify broker URL is correct
     - `4`: Bad credentials - Check username/password
     - `5`: Not authorized - Check permissions in HiveMQ dashboard

3. **SSL/TLS Problems**
   - Using `setInsecure()` bypasses certificate verification, which may not work on all networks
   - For higher security, use a proper CA certificate and `wifiClient.setCACert()`

### Hardware Issues
1. **DHT22 Readings Failed**
   - Check wiring connections (VCC, GND, Data)
   - Ensure 3.3V power is stable
   - Try a different DHT22 sensor if problems persist

2. **LEDs Not Working**
   - Verify correct GPIO pins (12, 13, 14)
   - Check LED polarity (longer leg is positive)
   - Confirm resistors are connected properly

3. **Buzzer Not Sounding**
   - Check wiring connections for all buzzers
   - Verify GPIO pins (21, 22, 23, 25)
   - Test with direct HIGH/LOW signals to isolate issue

4. **Button Not Triggering**
   - Verify pull-up resistor is connected
   - Check GPIO pin (5) configuration
   - Test button continuity with multimeter

### Software Troubleshooting
1. Run serial monitor at 115200 baud to view debug messages
2. Monitor MQTT messages using a client like MQTT Explorer
3. Use ArduinoOTA or Web Server to update firmware remotely
4. If ESP32 crashes, check for:
   - Memory leaks in loops
   - Stack overflow from recursive functions
   - Power supply issues (use capacitor between VCC/GND)
