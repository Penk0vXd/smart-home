# Uploading Web Interface Files to ESP32 SPIFFS

To upload the web interface files to the ESP32's SPIFFS (SPI Flash File System), you need to use the ESP32 Sketch Data Upload tool. Here's how to set it up and use it:

## For Arduino IDE 1.x:

1. Download the ESP32FS tool from https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin/releases/
2. Create a `tools` folder in your Arduino directory if it doesn't exist:
   - Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\Arduino\tools\`
   - Mac: `~/Documents/Arduino/tools/`
   - Linux: `~/Arduino/tools/`
3. Extract the downloaded ZIP file into this tools folder
4. Restart Arduino IDE

## For Arduino IDE 2.x:

1. Go to Tools > ESP32 Sketch Data Upload in Arduino IDE 2.x
2. If it's not installed, you'll be prompted to install it
3. Follow the installation prompts

## How to Upload Files:

1. Create a folder named `data` in your sketch folder (where your .ino file is)
2. Place the `index.html` file in this data folder
3. Connect your ESP32 to your computer
4. Select the correct board and port in Arduino IDE
5. Go to Tools > ESP32 Sketch Data Upload

## Verifying the Upload:

Once uploaded, the ESP32 should serve the web interface when you access its IP address in a browser.

## Troubleshooting:

- If you receive an error about missing files, ensure the data folder is created and contains your files
- If upload fails, try resetting the ESP32 and reconnecting
- Make sure you've selected the correct board and port in Arduino IDE
- If the file isn't displayed, check if the SPIFFS initialization in your code is successful
